# Overview
This project demonstrates how AI-powered automation can pull together data from multiple sources and deliver it in a clean, useful daily email. The focus is on showing workflow design, API integration, and automated formatting, rather than just raw coding.

Think of it like a Daily Dashboard Generator: one automation pulls in weather updates, news, stock/crypto prices, and calendar events, then formats everything into a neat email digest for the user.

The project structure is set up where the core work lives in:

- src/ → Core frontend logic (React components, app setup)
- public/ → Static assets
- workflow/ → n8n workflow handling API calls + formatting
- agents/ → A single AI agent that writes the final email from structured inputs

## Why This Project Works
- Practical → Everyone can use a daily digest of weather/news/finance/events.
- Showcases API Integration → Combines multiple data sources into one workflow.
- Clean Automation → Removes manual effort; user just gets the end result.
- Readable Output → Instead of dumping raw JSON, the AI formats everything into a human-friendly email.

## Why the Email Placeholder?
The send email llm serves two purposes:

- Professional Output → Instead of raw AI responses, recipients receive a polished, branded message.
- Automation Showcase → Demonstrates how n8n + AI can generate usable business communication with minimal manual editing.

This shows the potential for client updates, reports, or alerts to be automatically created and sent without needing human formatting.

## Technologies Used
- React.js → Frontend framework for structured UI.
- Node.js → Backend runtime environment.
- JavaScript (ES6+) → Core development language.
- n8n → Automation platform managing workflows.
- OpenRouter (for compatible LLMs) → For natural language email generation
- Free opensource weather/cryoto/news urls/api was used.
